# logoAnimationPrototype

Prototype animation for company logo.

This prototype was used to determine how my planned logo animation would work on a fundamental level.

Once the basic animations were behaving here as expected, it became easy to replace the circle and rectangle <svg> shapes with .png files to complete the full look.
