# logoAnimationPrototype

Prototype animation for company logo.

This prototype was used to plan a logo animation and test the <svg> code on a fundamental level.

Once the basic animations were behaving here as expected, it became simple to replace regular geometric shapes with .png/.jpg files to complete the full look.
